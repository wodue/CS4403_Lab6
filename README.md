# The Task
You will find a simple neural network implementation for modeling house prices, given certain features, here:

https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1927LqJvRQQJs8qgg2ZupivhbWhPgIhTU?usp=sharing

It uses the same dataset we used before:

As you can see I am not a very good data scientist, and am getting a pretty abysmal MAE (mean absolute error) score.

It is your task to explore the documentation for the Keras neural network library,  and adjust the configuration of the model to improve its performance.

# Consider:

 - using different combinations of features

 - using more or less neurons

 - adding more layers

 - using a different activation function

 - running more epochs

 - anything else you note in the documentation that may help

How low can you get the MAE score?
